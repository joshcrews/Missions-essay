h1. Go to All Nations

On why we must prioritize the discipling of unreached[1] and unengaged[2] people groups over general Global Outreach

bq. Matthew 28:19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

The unreached and unengaged people groups are the unfinished business of the Great Commission.  If a church does not prioritize discipling the unreached/unengaged people groups it is not obeying the Great Commission.

h2. A distinction between Global Outreach and Missions

Global outreach is the work of the church to relieve suffering, and instruct sinners, and support the church worldwide.

Paul was eager to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome (encourage the church) and be mutually encouraged by the faith of the Roman church; but it was not his goal or his end.  His sights were set on Spain--an unengaged people group.

bq. 19b from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ [I’ve planted new churches]; 20 and thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on someone else's foundation, 21 but as it is written,
“Those who have never been told of him will see, and those who have never heard will understand.”

bq. 23 But now, since I no longer have any room for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you, 24 I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain [missions--his next big goal], and to be helped on my journey there by you, once I have enjoyed your company for a while. 25 At present, however, I am going to Jerusalem bringing aid to the saints. [global outreach] ... 28 When therefore I have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected, I will leave for Spain by way of you.  --Romans 15

To Paul, missions (go to Spain) was distinct from visiting Rome (where church is already  functioning) and bring aid to the saints in Jerusalem (relieving the poor/supporting the church).

If a church is not engaged in creating a church-planting movement in a nation that needs one, it is not engaged in missions (but rather global outreach).

The term _missions_ should be defined as completing the Great Commission (Go therefore and make disciples of all nations).  It should not be used to describe a church trip to Honduras to help the people, or evangelize, or to train Christians.  All those things are obedience to Christ.  But if we use the term _missions_ it can get confused with completing the Great Commission.  And the work of the Great Commission remaining is the unreached/unengaged people groups.

h2. Why not all people?

Isn’t discipling my co-worker, my children, my neighbor a part of the Great Commission?

No.  That is the day-to-day normal work of the church.  Paul to Timothy in sending him to help the Greek church in Turkey -- 
‘As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, *do the work of an evangelist*, fulfill your ministry.’

The Great Commission is different and is not directed at every single individual, but at all nations.  Christ could have said ‘make disciples of everyone’ or ‘all people’ or ‘every creature’; and perhaps he does that command that elsewhere.

But the Great Commission is to all nations and not to all people.  That means we are to prioritize unreached nations over unreached individuals.

If this is true, we must now ask the question,  Where are nations that are not discipled, taught and baptized?

h2. A look at the data from the Joshua Project, an online Christian data collector for the progress of the Great Commission

At the Joshua Project[3], if you search for Unengaged people groups, you get these results by region (as of 2/1/2011)


# North America incl. Caribbean (4 groups, totalling 4,800 people)
## USA: 0 groups, Canada, 0 groups.
## Caribbean: 4 groups averaging 1,200 people each, all with homelands in Asia.
## No groups in Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic (all ‘mission trip’ hotspots)
# Central/Latin America (55 groups, totalling 77,000 people
## Mexico: 5 groups averaging 3,000 people each
## Most groups (40) are in Brazil and have between 20-500 people each.
## No groups in Nicaragua, Guatemala, Belize, Ecuador, El Salvador
# East and Southern Africa (120 groups, totalling 12 million people)
## Largest in this region: The Guhayna of Sudan with 1.7 million.

# Western and Central Africa (93 people groups, 1.5 million)
# South Asia (151 peoples, 23 million persons in those unengaged peoples)
# Southeast Asia (179 unengaged tribes, 2 million persons)
## Many tribalist religions/Islam/Buddhist groups, all without a on-the-ground, long-term church-planting engagement
# Northeast Asia (217 nations, 8.6 million people in those nations)
## Mostly minority peoples in China and North Korea
# Eastern Europe (19 groups, 130,000 people)
## Most groups are Islamic peoples in Russia
# Western Europe (56 groups, 2 million)
## Many groups with homelands in Asia
# Central Asia (184 groups, 4.2 million)
## Islamic stronghold.  6 of these groups have over 100,000 people.
# South Pacific (3 groups, 3,000 people)
## Only one group is native, the Cocos islanders with 400 people.
	
h2. In conclusion

Gosh!  There’s a gold mine of Great Commission opportunities sitting there for any church with the means to start reaching them.  Also-- working towards completing the Great Commission is guaranteed success.  If a church begins a work towards an unreached people group but never sees results; the results will eventually come because every people group will be represented in Christ.  I believe God would somehow use the 'failed' attempt at reaching an unreached group when the venture later succeeds.  There are not many opportunities with guaranteed success, but attempting to reach an unreached people group is one of them.

A church could go to nations (people groups) that are already reached, but if it prioritizes reached groups at the expense of unreached groups it is being disobedient to the Great Commission.  The Great Commission is only closer to completion as a new nation is taught, baptized and becomes disciples.

If we only work with reached people groups, our labor is in the same category as home ministries just with a broader geographical context.  

If we do not prioritize unreached/unengaged people groups, I predict they will go neglected.  These groups are unreached because they are difficult to reach.  If we don't set reaching them as the goal, we are choosing creative avoidance to the command given in Matthew 28:19.

h3. A parable of a sales manager

Imagine a new mobile phone company that desires to have a presence in every state.  The sales director says: ‘salespeople, go into all states and signup new customers’.  The salespeople go into the Southeast and sign up a lot of customers.  New salespeople also go into the Southeast and sign up more customers.  The next sales people also go to the Southeast, continually talking about how all the best opportunities for new customers lay in the Southeast, and many more people there are to sign up in the Southeast.

What will that sales manager say to his sales force?  “I did not ask you to sign up as many customers as possible, but rather to sign up customers out of all 50 states”.

h3. Footnotes

fn1. unreached: An unreached or least-reached people is a people group among which there is no indigenous community of believing Christians with adequate numbers and resources to evangelize this people group. ("http://www.joshuaproject.net/definitions.php":http://www.joshuaproject.net/definitions.php)  The people at Joshua Project say that 2% evangelical is there estimated threshold for a church to have within itself the resources to reach the rest of its people.

fn2. unengaged: A people group is engaged when a church planting strategy, consistent with Evangelical faith and practice, is under implementation. ("http://www.joshuaproject.net/definitions.php":http://www.joshuaproject.net/definitions.php)  That means it's even farther behind 'unreached'.

h2. Appendix A

To address the question of didn't Jesus really as "As you are going" make disciples?  If he did, we have poor scholarship in english Bible translation across the major translations.  Here's Matthew 28:19 in multiple translations.

This issue of 'as you are going' is important, because it can be used to say 'local disciple making is sufficient obedience to the Great Commission'.  If that's true, perhaps we are not commanded to go to the unreached people groups.

This appendix is to rebut that claim and support the claim that we are commanded to go.
